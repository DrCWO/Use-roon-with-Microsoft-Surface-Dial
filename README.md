# Use-roon-with-Microsoft-Surface-Dial
A Raspberry Pi image to control the musicserver roon wireless with a Microsoft Surface Dial

In this repository you can download the "rooExtend" image for a Raspberry Pi zero w or Raspberry Pi 4. This image enables the Raspberry to act as a communication bridge between the Bluetooth operated Microsoft Surface Dial and the music server roon.

The Raspberry Pi can be run completely wireless if you connect the Raspberry Pi to your local WiFi network. For more details see the Quick Installation Guide in this repository.
Running the image on the Raspberry Pi creates an extension inside the roon user interface. With this extension you can map spin and press actions of the Surface Dial to different functions of roon. For example, you can Stop/Play roon by pressing the Surface Dial and change volume by spinning the Surface Dial.

The image can be downloaded and setup on the Raspberry Pi for free. Controlling a dedicated roon playback zone inside roon requires a license. Please find more details and the  download link to the image here https://sellcodes.com/7oWuMUUF. Sorry but githup does'nt allow so big files.
